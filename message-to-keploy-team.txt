Hi @Achanandhi! 👋

I just implemented Keploy testing in my project **AI-StoryForge** - a multimodal AI-powered story generator! 🎉

**Project:** https://github.com/Nsanjayboruds/AI-StoryForge-Multimodal-Story-Generator

**What I'm testing with Keploy:**
✅ Node.js/Express REST API
✅ AI story generation (Groq API with LLaMA models)
✅ Image generation (HuggingFace Stable Diffusion)
✅ MongoDB user authentication
✅ Multiple external API integrations

**Why I chose Keploy:**
- Zero test code - automatic test generation from API traffic
- Built-in mocking for external APIs (Groq, HuggingFace, Replicate)
- MongoDB query recording and replay
- Perfect for CI/CD pipelines

**Implementation highlights:**
- Complete keploy.yml configuration
- Custom test scripts for easy workflow
- Docker Compose setup for containerized testing
- Comprehensive documentation

**Setup verification:** All tests passing ✅
- Keploy 3.3.10 installed and working
- Server responds successfully
- Test recording and playback functional

I'd love to add this to the Keploy Adopters list! I've prepared the submission document and can open a PR. 

**Tech Stack:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Groq AI, HuggingFace, Replicate

Would be happy to share more details about the implementation or create a blog post/case study if that would help the community!

Let me know if you need any additional information. Thanks for building such an awesome tool! 🚀
